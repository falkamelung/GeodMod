## Geodetic modelling software in Matlab


### 1. Installation

#### 1.1 Setup environment path

Add the following to your _~/.bashrc_:

```
alias matlab=/Applications/MATLAB_R2019a.app/bin/matlab
export MATLAB_USE_USERPATH=1

##--------- GEODMOD ------------------##
export GEODMOD_HOME=~/Documents/test/test1/geodmod
export GEODMOD_TESTDATA=~/Documents/testdata/geodmod
export GEODMOD_TESTBENCH=~/Downloads/TESTBENCH
```

#### 1.2 Download

```
git clone https://github.com/geodesymiami/GeodMod.git $GEODMOD_HOME
```

#### 1.3 Setup matlab path

Add the following to your _startup.m_ file in _USER/matlab_ for Matlab to initiate the configuration:

```matlab
%% Setting for GeodMod
disp('Setting paths for geodmod...')
run( [ getenv('GEODMOD_HOME') filesep 'addpath_geodmod'] )
```

### 2. Test Run
Download test data

```
mkdir -p $GEODMOD_TESTDATA
cd $GEODMOD_TESTDATA
wget https://zenodo.org/record/3348961/files/geodmod_testdata.xz
tar -xvJf  geodmod_testdata.xz
```
Start matlab program from terminal to initiate the environment variables defined above.

```
matlab
>>geodmod Darwin.min
>>geodmod Wells.min
```

### 3. Tips
You can disable most of the plotting (quick runs) using:
```
inverseopt.QuickStop                 = true
plotthemodelopt.DoIt                 = off
plotsurface3dopt.DoIt                = off
inverseopt.distribopt.DoIt           = off
```

### 4. Dislocation  convention
Geodmod uses the same dislocation code as GBIS. See the GBIS manual for  definition of the parameters.

In contrast to GBIS geodmod always requires the strike-slip, downdip and opening component. GBIS requires for a fault onlt the first two and for a dike the last (the unused components are set to zero internally).

The relationship between dip and strike is the same with that of GBIS(right hand rule);
But for the middle point (Xiaoran):
In Geodmod, the middle point always loated at the lower edge; In GBIS, the location of middle point has relationship with the dip(negtive dip means middle point locates at the upper edge while positive dip means middle point locates at the lower edge).

Second addition to upstream before everything else.

Addition to upstream that needs to bbe removed

This is from fork and should go on top of master
